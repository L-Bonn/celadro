TODO:
====
* Rm and filesystem from C++17
* zip from cmake?
* implement nice git flow (master, hotfix, etc)
* switch to int for indices?
* switch to array of structures for more cache locality

DONE:
====
* Replace derivatives with midpoint stencils.
* Create back object to hold all variables and separate functions into
  different files (model.hpp, init.cpp, update.cpp, stats.cpp, etc).
  -> simplify serialization
